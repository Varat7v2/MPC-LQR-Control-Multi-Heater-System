# MPC-LQR-Control-Multi-Heater-System
Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Linear Quadratic Control (LQR) designed and implemented in a real-time system i.e. single board multi-heater system (SBMHS) for controlling temperature underneath each of those four heaters. Both of the control method viz. servo (changing the setpoint temperature) and regulatory (noise cancellation) were implemented.
